# Developing

This document contains tips, workflows, and more for local development within this repository.

More documentation for maintainers and developers of Fleet can be found in [docs/](docs/).

## Dev Scripts & Running E2E Tests

Development scripts are provided under `/dev` to make it easier setting up a local development Fleet standalone environment and running the E2E tests against it. These scripts are intended only for local Fleet development, not for production nor any other real world scenario.

Setting up the local development environment and running the E2E tests is described in the [/dev/README.md](/dev/README.md).
