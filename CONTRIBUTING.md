# Contributing to Fleet

Fleet accepts contributions via GitHub issues and pull requests.
This document outlines the process to get your pull request accepted.

Fleet does accept external contributions in general, however the team's time is limited. Fleet is on a quarterly release cycle, so it might take a long time for external contributions to be commented on, let alone reviewed and merged. We expect review times to improve in the future.

## Start With An Issue

Prior to creating a pull request it is a good idea to [create an issue].
This is especially true if the change request is something large.
The bug, feature request, or other type of issue can be discussed prior to
creating the pull request. This can reduce rework.

[Create an issue]: https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/new

## Pull Requests

Pull requests for a code change should reference the issue they are related to.
This will enable issues to serve as a central point of reference for a change.
For example, if a pull request fixes or completes an issue the commit or
pull request should include:

```md
Refers #123
```

In this case 123 is the corresponding issue number.

We leave issues open, until the quality assurance team reviewed them.

## Semantic Versioning

Fleet follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
While Fleet is still on 0.y.z, we stay backwards compatible and avoid breaking changes. We increase the minor version when new features are added.

This does not cover other tools included in Fleet.

## Coding Style

Fleet expects its Go code to be formatted with `goimports`.

Fleet further follows the style guidelines at

  - [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and
  - [Go Wiki Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
  - [Go Style At Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/guide)
