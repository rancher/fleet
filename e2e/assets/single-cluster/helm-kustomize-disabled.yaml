# Kustomize is supposed to be disabled if no configuration file for Kustomize
# exists that would need to be honored. This prevents issues with file and
# archive names, which are restricted in Kustomize but helm has no issues with
# them (like a plus in the filename). In fact, helm even creates file names with
# a plus symbol if the version in Chart.yaml contains it.
