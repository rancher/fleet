# Expected Repo Structure

**The git repository has no explicitly required structure.** It is important
to realize the scanned resources will be saved as a resource in Kubernetes so
you want to make sure the directories you are scanning in git do not contain
arbitrarily large resources. Right now there is a limitation that the resources
deployed must **gzip to less than 1MB**.

## How repos are scanned

Multiple paths can be defined for a `GitRepo` and each path is scanned independently.
Internally each scanned path will become a [bundle](./concepts.md) that Fleet will manage,
deploy, and monitor independently.

The following files are looked for to determine the how the resources will be deployed.

| File | Location | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Chart.yaml**:| / relative to `path` or custom path from `fleet.yaml` | The resources will be deployed as a Helm chart. Refer to the `fleet.yaml` for more options. |
| **kustomization.yaml**:| / relative to `path` or custom path from `fleet.yaml` | The resources will be deployed using Kustomize. Refer to the `fleet.yaml` for more options. |
| **fleet.yaml** | Any subpath | If any fleet.yaml is found a new [bundle](./concepts.md) will be defined. This allows mixing charts, kustomize, and raw YAML in the same repo |
| ** *.yaml ** | Any subpath | If a `Chart.yaml` or `kustomization.yaml` is not found then any `.yaml` file will be assumed to be a Kubernetes resource and will be deployed. |
| **overlays/{name}** | / relative to `path` | When deploying using raw YAML (not Kustomize or Helm) `overlays` is a special directory for customizations. |

## `fleet.yaml`

The `fleet.yaml` is an optional file that can be included in the git repository to change the behavior of how
the resources are deployed and customized.  The `fleet.yaml` is always at the root relative to the `path` of the `GitRepo`
and if a subdirectory is found with a `fleet.yaml` a new [bundle](./concepts.md) is defined that will then be
configured differently from the parent bundle.

### Reference

```yaml
# The default namespace to be applied to resources. This field is not used to
# enforce or lock down the deployment to a specific namespace, but instead
# provide the default value of the namespace field if one is not specified
# in the manifests.
# Default: default
defaultNamespace: default

# All resources will be assigned to this namespace and if any cluster scoped
# resource exists the deployment will fail.
# Default: ""

kustomize:
  # Use a custom folder for kustomize resources. This folder must contain
  # a kustomization.yaml file.

helm:
  # Use a custom location for the Helm chart. This can refer to any go-getter URL.
  # This allows one to download charts from most any location.  Also know that
  # go-getter URL supports adding a digest to validate the download. If repo
  # is set below this field is the name of the chart to lookup
  chart: ./chart
  # A https URL to a Helm repo to download the chart from. It's typically easier
  # to just use `chart` field and refer to a tgz file.  If repo is used the
  # value of `chart` will be used as the chart name to lookup in the Helm repository.

!!! hint "Private Helm Repo"
    For a private Helm repo, users can reference a secret with the following keys:
    
    1. `username` and `password` for basic http auth if the Helm HTTP repo is behind basic auth.
    
    2. `cacerts` for custom CA bundle if the Helm repo is using a custom CA.
    
    3. `ssh-privatekey` for ssh private key if repo is using ssh protocol. Private key with passphase is not supported currently.
    
    For example, to add a secret in kubectl, run 
    
    `kubectl create secret -n $namespace generic helm --from-literal=username=foo --from-literal=password=bar --from-file=cacerts=/path/to/cacerts --from-file=ssh-privatekey=/path/to/privatekey.pem`
    
    After secret is created, specify the secret to `gitRepo.spec.helmSecretName`. Make sure secret is created under the same namespace with gitrepo.

## Per Cluster Customization

The `GitRepo` defines which clusters a git repository should be deployed to and the `fleet.yaml` in the repository
determines how the resources are customized per target.

All clusters and cluster groups in the same namespace as the `GitRepo` will be evaluated against all targets of that
`GitRepo`. The targets list is evaluated one by one and if there is a match the resource will be deployed to the cluster.
If no match is made against the target list on the `GitRepo` then the resources will not be deployed to that cluster.
Once a target cluster is matched the `fleet.yaml` from the git repository is then consulted for customizations. The
`targetCustomizations` in the `fleet.yaml` will be evaluated one by one and the first match will define how the
resource is to be configured. If no match is made the resources will be deployed with no additional customizations.

There are three approaches to matching clusters for both `GitRepo` `targets` and `fleet.yaml` `targetCustomizations`.
One can use cluster selectors, cluster group selectors, or an explicit cluster group name.  All criteria is additive so
the final match is evaluated as "clusterSelector && clusterGroupSelector && clusterGroup".  If any of the three have the
default value it is dropped from the criteria.  The default value is either null or "".  It is important to realize
that the value `{}` for a selector means "match everything."

```yaml
# Match everything
clusterSelector: {}
# Selector ignored
clusterSelector: null
```

## Raw YAML Resource Customization

When using Kustomize or Helm the `kustomization.yaml` or the `helm.values` will control how the resource are
customized per target cluster. If you are using raw YAML then the following simple mechanism is built-in and can
be used.  The `overlays/` folder in the git repo is treated specially as folder containing folders that
can be selected to overlay on top per target cluster. The resource overlay content
uses a file name based approach.  This is different from kustomize which uses a resource based approach.  In kustomize
the resource Group, Kind, Version, Name, and Namespace identify resources and are then merged or patched.  For Fleet
the overlay resources will override or patch content with a matching file name.

```shell
# Base files
deployment.yaml
svc.yaml

# Overlay files

# The following file we be added
overlays/custom/configmap.yaml
# The following file will replace svc.yaml
overlays/custom/svc.yaml
# The following file will patch deployment.yaml
overlays/custom/deployment_patch.yaml
```

A file named `foo` will replace a file called `foo` from the base resources or a previous overlay.  In order to patch
the contents a file the convention of adding `_patch.` (notice the trailing period) to the filename is used. The string `_patch.`
will be replaced with `.` from the file name and that will be used as the target.  For example `deployment_patch.yaml`
will target `deployment.yaml`.  The patch will be applied using JSON Merge, Strategic Merge Patch, or JSON Patch.
Which strategy is used is based on the file content. Even though JSON strategies are used, the files can be written
using YAML syntax.
 
## Cluster and Bundle state

Clusters and Bundles have different states in each phase of applying Bundles.

For Bundles:

**Ready**: Bundles have been deployed and all resources are ready.

**NotReady**: Bundles have been deployed and some resources are not ready.

**WaitApplied**: Bundles have been synced from Fleet controller and downstream cluster, but are waiting to be deployed.

**ErrApplied**: Bundles have been synced from the Fleet controller and the downstream cluster, but there were some errors when deploying the Bundle.

**OutOfSync**: Bundles have been synced from Fleet controller, but downstream agent hasn't synced the change yet.

**Pending**: Bundles are being processed by Fleet controller.

**Modified**: Bundles have been deployed and all resources are ready, but there are some changes that were not made from the Git Repository.

For Clusters:

**WaitCheckIn**: Waiting for agent to report registration information and cluster status back.

**NotReady**: There are bundles in this cluster that are in NotReady state. 

**WaitApplied**: There are bundles in this cluster that are in WaitApplied state.

**ErrApplied**: There are bundles in this cluster that are in ErrApplied state.

**OutOfSync**: There are bundles in this cluster that are in OutOfSync state.

**Pending**: There are bundles in this cluster that are in Pending state.

**Modified**: There are bundles in this cluster that are in Modified state.

**Ready**: Bundles in this cluster have been deployed and all resources are ready.
